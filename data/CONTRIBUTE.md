## 1. Decide where to start your search

We have compiled a list of sources in our wiki. If you have other ideas, please add them here as well. They should allow us to go "back in time" and re-visit the digital landscape (the web, social media, newspapers etc.) in the year 2000.

## 2. Look for subject-specific sources, cast a wide net

Don‚Äôt limit yourself to the first few results in the search engine. Look beyond the first page of search results to find information for your research. Most of us do not have the time and patience for more than the first page. But you can try.

## 3. Use GPT and search engines with caution

Be aware that simply because you find information online does not make it credible or authoritative. Anyone can make a webpage, and we mean *anyone*. There are tons of poor, unverified, misattributed, and just plain wrong information online. Keep calm and carry on.

## 4. Choose your keywords carefully

Use specific keyword phrases to locate the most relevant information. Use alternate words or keyword phrases to locate additional research sources. For example, if you are researching "football", consider using "soccer" or "pigskin sport" or "beautiful game".

## 5. Ask a librarian!

Maybe you know one, maybe you can find one on social media. At least, drop us a line - we will try our best to help out.
